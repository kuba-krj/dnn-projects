# Projects in Deep Neural Networks

## Data noise - eperiments
The goal of this project was to check and visualize effect of noise in data on the
training process of a neural network model. Different types and levels of
noise have been considered. 

## Object detection
The goal of this project was to solve object detection training and predicition
task using anchor-based approach. The whole architecture is based on the
paper introductiong Retina Loss.

## RNN
The goal of this project was to use the LGTM model to tag sentiment in the 
imdb reviews dataset.

## DDPG
The goal of this project was to implement the DDPG algoritghm for Reinforcement
Learning with continuous action space.
